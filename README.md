# Introduction
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7be4009e-9ad8-4f20-a434-6456846d08f2)  

A new Translation Patcher for Rondo of Blood's English Patch.  
This is **NOT** a new translation just a new patcher script, since I had some problems with the old patcher.  
All hacking credit goes to the creators of the patch: https://www.romhacking.net/translations/846/  
The patch is however included in this repo for user convinience.

I have created two seperate scripts.  
A Powershell 5 Script for Windows users and a SHELL Script for Linux users.  

Yes, you will have to use the terminal. **But do not fear!**  
I have attempted to make the experience as user friendly as possibly with overly detailed instructions. 

# Disclaimer

*For obvious reasons, I will not show you how to obtain the game files. You should, of course, buy a legitimate copy (they go for around $200 on eBay) and rip it yourself. Pretty cool to own if nothing else — but I'm getting off-topic.*

*Anyway, **I do not endorse or condone piracy of any kind**. This repo includes some audio and imagery from the game — nothing that can't easily be found on YouTube or with a quick Google image search.  
If the rightful owners believe any content in this repo should be taken down, I will promptly and willingly comply.*

If you are feeling adventurous, there is a `readme.txt` in each folder that explains some things.  
They don't really serve much purpose, but might be fun to read.
