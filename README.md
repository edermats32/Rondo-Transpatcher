# Rondo-Transpatcher
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7be4009e-9ad8-4f20-a434-6456846d08f2)  

A new Translation Patcher for Rondo of Blood's English Patch.  
This is **NOT** a new translation just a new patcher script, since I had some problems with the old patcher.

There is two seperate scripts. One SHELL Script for Linux users and one Powershell 5 Script for Windows users.  

Yes, you will have to use the terminal. **But do not fear!**  
I have attempted to make the experience as user friendly as possibly with overly detailed instructions.
