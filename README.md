# Rondo-Transpatcher
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7be4009e-9ad8-4f20-a434-6456846d08f2)  
Just a new script to apply the English Translation Patch for Rondo of Blood. Supports bin+cue (multiple bin-files) as well as iso+wav+cue. I have nothing to do with the development of the patch.
