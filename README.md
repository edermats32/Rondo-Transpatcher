# Rondo-Transpatcher
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1859c2c1-700b-4d10-9fbf-6cd9d27c7d64)  
Just a new script to apply the English Translation Patch for Rondo of Blood. Supports bin+cue (multiple bin-files) as well as iso+wav+cue. I have nothing to do with the development of the patch.
